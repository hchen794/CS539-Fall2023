This is the GitHub repo for ECE539 Group13 Project -- Stroke Detection.
The goal of this project is to use multiple machine learning classification algorithms to predict
whether a patient have a stroke based on several parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and
smoking status. The Stroke Detection project is progressing as planned. We have rigorously
explored our dataset, implementing preprocessing measures and conducting a thorough
visualization and analysis. Following baseline research, we successfully validate an example
algorithm on Kaggle[1]. Subsequently, we used several models including Support Vector
Classification (SVC), Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.These
models were further refined using k-fold cross-validation. The performance of these algorithms was
evaluated using confusion matrix, recall, AUC and other relevant metrics.
